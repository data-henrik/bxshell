# Once Dashboard is installed and accessible we can focus on configuring access control
# to the cluster resources for users. As of release 1.7 Dashboard no longer has full admin
# privileges granted by default. All the privileges are revoked and only minimal privileges
# granted, that are required to make Dashboard work.

# The following brings back the Admin priviledges
